About Me
---

I'm a curious and motivated student with a strong interest in Product Management and Business Analysis. I enjoy learning how great products are builtâ€”from understanding user needs to analyzing data and shaping strategies. I'm currently exploring tools, frameworks, and real-world case studies to deepen my skills, and I'm excited about opportunities to collaborate, grow, and contribute to impactful projects.
